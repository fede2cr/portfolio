### Splack Linux
Slackware Linux is a beautiful distribution but has only been available for x86 based computers. Some years back the Slackware team grew for a small while and started porting Slackware for Sparc as well as PPC. This efforts where only sustained for some months and then abandoned.

I took the partial Slackware for Sparc distribution that was being mantained by David Cantrell, renamed it (as it is not a Slackware official project) as Splack, and maitained it for several years and release cycles.

The distribution was used in production in Universidad Latina de Costa Rica, as well as a univerity in Norway, and had a small but loyal community of users eager to test new packages and feedback. After recruiting two part time developers for the project I lost all of the Sparc resources for building the distribution so I hand it over to the Universidad Latina team as well as the Spack Linux community.

### LKML

I was quite active in the Linux Kernel Mailing list, debugging and testing kernels for the SPARC and UltraSPARC arquitecture. Infamously, I once had a fight with Alan Cox, that I guess I won in the sense that the patch I complained about to this day breaks audio on some Sun models.

### SGI Mailing list

I collaborated with the XFS filesystem team from Silicon Graphics when the filesystem port for Linux was still very early. I mostly ran long regression tests in my SPARC and UltraSPARC testing hardware, tested patches for them.

### Developer for the Gentoo Linux distribution
While trying the Gentoo distrution in the SPARC/UltraSPARC arquitecture, I found lot's of very minor bugs and packages that have not been ported to this arquitecture, so I spent a bit of time in the IRC submitting small patches.

After helping the gentoo-sparc team to hunt down a couple of XMMS weird errors, I was offered an developer account for the distribution and became a Gentoo developer for a short period of time.

## Business

### Greencore Solutions

Greencore is born out of local talent without venture capital or any other form of external financing, to provide a professional technical support for GNU/Linux servers that was lacking heavily at the time and was keeping a lot of government and private bussineses from migrating to free software.

From the start we partnered with the free software and Linux community in Costa Rica by sponsoring events, giving out lectures, participating in installfest, handing out GNU/Linux distributions and welcoming questions from newbie users as well as bussines owners that were newbie to GNU/Linux.
