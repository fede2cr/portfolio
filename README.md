Some of the stuff that makes me a polymath

## Costa Rica's free software community

- GULCR: GNU/Linux was in the country very early, where a community of users call Grupo de Usuarios de Linux de Costa Rica formed around the main tech universities at the time: Universidad Latina where I worked, Universidad de Costa Rica and Tecnológico de Costa Rica.
As an active member of the Group we organized and participated in advocacy fair around the country with installfest, lectures and demostrations. We got to bring Phil Huges and later Richard Stallman. I also served as listmaster and webmaster.

- RCSL: A savory note from having Stallman is that he would not take pictures or participate with GULCR because the name does not include "GNU" on it's name. Due to some administrative issues with the linux.or.cr domain, resources moved slowly to the Red Costarricense de Software Libre. By this time my company Greencore already started to we sponsored many fairs and events.

## Fairs

Most of them as collaborator.

## Unix Developer Timeline

Splack Linux: 2001
LKML: 2002
SGI XFS Mailing list: 2002

### Splack Linux
Slackware Linux is a beautiful distribution but has only been available for x86 based computers. Some years back the Slackware team grew for a small while and started porting Slackware for Sparc as well as PPC. This efforts where only sustained for some months and then abandoned.

I took the partial Slackware for Sparc distribution that was being maintained by David Cantrell, renamed it (as it is not a Slackware official project) as Splack, and maintained it for several years and release cycles.

The distribution was used in production in Universidad Latina de Costa Rica, as well as a university in Norway, and had a small but loyal community of users eager to test new packages and feedback. After recruiting two part time developers for the project I lost all of the Sparc resources for building the distribution so I hand it over to the Universidad Latina team as well as the Spack Linux community.

### LKML

I was quite active in the Linux Kernel Mailing list, debugging and testing kernels for the SPARC and UltraSPARC architecture. Infamously, I once had a fight with Alan Cox, that I guess I won in the sense that the patch I complained about to this day breaks audio on some Sun models.

### SGI Mailing list

I collaborated with the XFS file system team from Silicon Graphics when the file system port for Linux was still very early. I mostly ran long regression tests in my SPARC and UltraSPARC testing hardware, tested patches for them.

### Developer for the Gentoo Linux distribution
While trying the Gentoo distribution in the SPARC/UltraSPARC architecture, I found lot's of very minor bugs and packages that have not been ported to this architecture, so I spent a bit of time in the IRC submitting small patches.

After helping the gentoo-sparc team to hunt down a couple of XMMS weird errors, I was offered an developer account for the distribution and became a Gentoo developer for a short period of time.

## Business

### Greencore Solutions

Greencore is born out of local talent without venture capital or any other form of external financing, to provide a professional technical support for GNU/Linux servers that was lacking heavily at the time and was keeping a lot of government and private businesses from migrating to free software.

From the start we partnered with the free software and Linux community in Costa Rica by sponsoring events, giving out lectures, participating in installfest, handing out GNU/Linux distributions and welcoming questions from newbie users as well as business owners that were newbie to GNU/Linux.

Currently Greencore provides support and consulting services to clients from government to private industry, as well as teach to all ages to topics from GNU/Linux server administration, information security, robotics with open hardware. We are training partners for Red Hat, Linux Foundation and Oracle, with the only Red Hat Certification Kiosk in Central America.

## Certifications

### Red Hat

I'm currently a Red Hat Certified Instructor and Examiner for Red Hat Learning Certifications, ID 140-205-758 as Red Hat Examiner (RHCX), RHCSA, RHCE, RHCSA-Openstack, RHCVA and an Certificate of Expertise in Ansible Automation.

- You can look at the complete list in the [Red Hat Website](https://www.redhat.com/rhtapps/certification/verify/?certId=140-205-758)

## Hobbies

### Brewing

I own an artisan brewery with production mostly concentrated for teaching how to brew plus my own experiments. I have isolated an active microbiome present in a local lambic wine made from a palm sap, and I'm experimenting with feeding it other types or saps or juices. Also brewing honey wine and kombucha.

In the near future I hope to expand to two brew pots to shorten the recipe time, and after that open something with the idea of a hackerspace, where people can come and learn and experiment without having to own expensive equipment. Has to be a tall place to accommodate a column distillation tower.

### Robotics

The Arduino bug bit me early, before the Arduino UNOs where even out. Shortly after starting with electronics I designed a CC-licensed Robotics course based around open hardware (instead of LEGOs which are the norm in Costa Rica) that we are using to teach hundreds of adults and dozens kids.

The ESP8266, SAMD21 and now ESP32 are opening IoT alternatives as well as programming in MicroPython/CircuitPython.

Most of my electronics/robotics projects are in my github repository, but I'll curate this list a bit more to make them easy to find.

- [CircuitPython Wifi Car](https://github.com/fede2cr/CircuitPython_WifiCar): A new version of the robotics workshop for kids, but now with a version of MicroPython that is simpler to learning and easier to do more powerfull stuff. In this project kids learn about robotic motion, and how to use sensors to create autonomy.

### Astronomy
As an amateur astronomer I know how frustrating it is to wait for weather to clear up, to manage a night schedule with a daytime work-schedule, but also how valuable is the work that amateur astronomers do every day.
I got myself a couple of Celestron Firstscope telescopes, one for teaching astronomy and another for hack to act as an autonomous observatory. With heavy use of 3d printing, Raspberry Pi, NoIR camera, the INDI library, infrared sensor for cloud detection and a DIY dome from a cheap camping tent.

The idea is to have a bunch of inexpensive mini-observatories in educational institutions around the country and world, and a control network to allow free usage of the any observatory available with clear skies. More observatories can also be joined together for better resolution, mosaics, weather fail over and more configurations.

### Biology: Plankton lab, yeast lab, synthetic bio
One of the rooms in my house was converted to a biology laboratory where I'm learning microscopy techniques and have started to gather a collection of plankton from water sources around the country.
An active microbiome present in a local lambic wine made from a palm sap called "vino de coyol" has been isolated and is now being tested for flavor profiles by using other inputs.
Some work has started to create a synthetic biology lab to tech kids but has been halted for the moment due to lack of resources for equipment. More and more crowd funded projects a trying to lower the cost.

### Luthier
All of my woodworking tools are for modifying and setting up guitars, form acoustic to electric, from fretted to fretless, electronic repair and setup, and others.
My experience so for have been in modifying an inexpensive mass produced bass to a fretless setup with acoustic and electroacoustic adjustments, setting up an acoustic metal string from a maker in Argentina, setting up a vintage floyd rose on an old Ibanez, electronics replacement on an active bass from Ibanez and currently doing a secret repair on a historic guitar from a master player from Costa Rica.
As soon as I have enough tools I plan to start the construction of an acoustic arched top fretless bass with piezo pickups embed in the neck.

### Music

I started playing way before I started modifying instruments. Played on a band in high school, and since have been learning complicated songs that takes me years to learn.

I'm trying to refine:
- Classical Thump from Victor Wooten, on 4 string fretted bass
- For the Love of God by Steve Vai, on 6 string electric guitar with sustainer
- Spanish Fly by Van Halen, on 6 string classic nylon string guitar

### Photography

While learning DSRL photography I got the chance of doing amateur work for Mundo Motorizado, a local sports news team, covering international rally events (NACAM), as well as GT1 class, motorbikes, national championships and others. I also enjoy photographing nature, amateur sports and public events.

![Photography](https://github.com/fede2cr/portfolio/blob/master/doc/img/fotografia/fotografia.gif "Photography")


On the non digital side of photography I created a CC-licensed workshop for kids and adults that includes the construction of a pin hole camera, and cyanotype paper usage, photographic paper and developing with non toxic household items such as coffee, mint tea, vitamin C, lemon juice.

![Greencore in mint](https://github.com/fede2cr/portfolio/blob/master/doc/img/fotografia/Greencore_in_mint.jpg "Greencore in mint")

Currently I'm learning multi-stacked microscopy and also solar astrophotography with inexpensive adapters, and planetary photography while testing parts for the Moore constellation project.

### Archaeology

The members of my father's side of the family have the tendency to "find" spear points everywhere so I started learning about different types of spear points and axes, construction and local sites to find them.
With success I have clarified a recent finding, identifying the piece as a flint that came out of the construction or a medium sized ax and how to blow was made and the angles used by the maker.

### Renewable energies: DIY solar panel class for kits
### FPGAs

The best way for me to learn something, is to teach it to others. Which is why at the same time that I tip my toes in how FPGAs work, I'm also writing a tutorial for others who want to learn.

The time is now as they are very cheap and can now be used with exclusively Free Software, which is something I'm not comfortable about other models that require proprietary Windows software to run.

Here you can see a [Truth table tutorial](https://github.com/fede2cr/fpga_playground/tree/master/tablas%20de%20verdad) and [Clock tutorial](https://github.com/fede2cr/fpga_playground/tree/master/relojes) where we start learning Verilog code.

### 3d printing

I own two Printerbots, a laser cut wood model called the Simple, and a Metal Plus. I normally print in PLA or Ninjaflex and would love to have double extrusion to print in both at the same time.

I have some of my designs in my [Thingiverse profile](http://www.thingiverse.com/fede2/about) but also in Github. Some examples:

- [Moore constellation](https://github.com/fede2cr/moore_constellation): I use inexpensive Celestron Firstscope Telescopes, remove some of the original parts and replace them with 3d printed parts. The objective is to have an autonomous observatory, so the parts are for adapting micro stepper motors (like the ones used in cameras), a focus adapter for a Raspberry Pi NoIR camera, and gears telescope for guidance.

- [Luthier tools](https://github.com/fede2cr/3d_luthier_tools): Lots of tools used in woodworking and on luthier work specially can be 3d printed. I use a number of 3d printed parts from other designers, and have also made guides for using screw extractor without a drill press.

- [Playground spool](https://github.com/fede2cr/playground_spool): In 3d printing is normal to have extrusion jams, specially on long prints or with flexible materials. So I decided to use the accelerometer in a CircuitPlayground to follow the rotation of the spool and notify with an audio alert if the spool stops feeding filament. Printed in flexible material but can be adjusted to print in PLA.

### Magrathea Terraforming

I'm combining drones with seeds bombs to aid in reforestation and afforestation, at the moment experimenting with seed dispersion for diverse seed/tree type.

[Github page](https://github.com/fede2cr/magrathean_terraforming_services)

### Woodworking

I'm currently building a wall clock with mechanical movement, using traditional woodworking techniques and learning more as I hope to get into future restoration projects and building more units. No photos yet as the first project is a secret.

### Book restoration and binding

Some of the books in my personal library have suffered some minor damage through the years so I'm using them as practice for learning book restoration traditional techniques, as well as creating a notebook with an embedded [Circuit Playground](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333).

### Languages

Either dead languages, artificial ones or even some I can actually use, I love to learn languages, even if I'm not great at practicing them once I've learned them on a basic level. Currently reading cuneiform, esperanto, portuguese, and noregian (bokmål).

### Cryptography

As every basic cryptographer should start, I have tried some basic exercises on the Voynich Manuscript, as well as doing by hand the techniques of Al Kindi. I try to use the things I learn with [teaching guides](https://github.com/fede2cr/greencore_wargames).
